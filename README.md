<h5> I'm currently attending the Awesome Inc. boot camp located in Lexington, Kentucky and enjoying every minute of this amazing experience.</h5>
<br>


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Onboarding process and look forward to the in-person session in the next few weeks.

- ðŸ’¬ Prior to boot camp I spent 20 years in investigations, specializing in digital forensics. After retirement I spent 4 years teaching social media investigations, blood stain pattern analysis, shooting reconstruction, and other crime scene techniques. I enjoy investigations, however my passion is in technology and electronics.

- âš¡ Fun fact: If you get the chance and have the time ask me about the vehicle pursuit with a 15-foot pumpkin!
